# TwitchTV Viewer

This is a Free Code Camp project for viewing a list of Twitch streamers. I made it using React & webpack as well as ES6. This project
had to fulfill the following user stories:

1. I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
2. I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel (I have modified this slightly - 
one need to click the name of the streamer rather than the status output).
3. if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

I have omitted the requirement to list a user which has closed the account because Twitch API is not so suitable for getting 
this data.
